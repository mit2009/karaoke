            `But I do know that I'll help you|And I know that if you need me too|What a wonderful lab this would be`,
            `Know a bunch about linkages|Know about manufacturing|Watch that show a lot "How It's Made"|I know what a slide rule is for`,
            `And I do know one and one is two|And if this team can have me too|What a wonderful lab this would be`,
            `Now, I don't claim to be a good teacher|But I'm trying to be|For maybe by helping, build a super product|I can earn an A for me`,
            `Know a bunch about prototypes|Know about technology|Know a bunch about a thermo book|Know about how long heat transfer took`,
            `And I do know that I'll help you|And I know that if you need me too|What a wonderful lab this would be`,
            `La ta ta ta ta ta ta (Linkages)|Hmm-mm-mm (Technology)|Whoa, la ta ta ta ta ta ta (How's It's Made)|Hmm-mm-mm (Hair is Grayed)`,
            `Yeah, but I do know that I'll help you,|And I know that if you need me too|What a wonderful lab this would be`,
            `~`,
            `Ooh, you make me live|Whatever this lab can give to you|For you, you're all I see|Ooh, you make me give now, students|Ooh, you make me live`,
            `Oh, you're the best students I ever had|I've been with you a semester, and your notebook|And I want you to know, that my feedback is true|I'll really miss you|(Ooh) Oh, I'm your mentor`,
            `Ooh, you make me give|Ooh, I've been wandering 'round|But still come critique you|In rain or shine, I'll stand by your side|I'm happy in lab|I'm your mentor`,
            `Ooh, you make me live|Whenever this world confuses you|you got me to help you move on|Ooh, you make me give now, students|Ooh, you make me give`,
            `Oh, I'm the first one, when prototypes fail|You know, we'll always repair it, you're my only team|And I love the work|I really love the work that you do|I'm your mentor`
